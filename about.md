I'm a software developer at [Sesam](https://sesam.io/), an iPaaS company based in Oslo where I'm dividing my time between frontend (React/Redux) and backend (Python).

I have previously worked as a full-stack developer at Nornir in Oslo. In 2016 I took a summer internship at [CERN](https://home.cern/), where I built a small web [application](https://sba-beams.web.cern.ch/) for displaying data about beamlines operating in CERNs North & East Experimental Areas

I have a Bachelor degree in Computer Graphics and Visualizations from [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/en) in Brno, Czech Republic. Currently I am also studying for a Masters degree at [IFI UiO](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/) in Oslo. I enjoy solving problems that deal with processing and visualizing data and I'm interested in developer tooling, programming language theory and software architecture. I'm a big fan of React's declarative programming model.
