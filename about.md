I'm a software developer at an iPaaS company called Sesam, based in Oslo, where I'm dividing my time between frontend (React/Redux) and backend (Python).

I have previously worked as a full-stack developer at Nornir in Oslo. In 2016 I took a summer internship at CERN, where I built a small web application website for displaying data about beamlines operating in CERNs North & East Experimental Areas.

I have a Bachelor degree in Computer Graphics and Visualizations from Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic. Currently I am also studying for a Masters degree at IFI UiO in Oslo. I enjoy solving problems that deal with processing and visualizing data and I'm interested in developer tooling, programming language theory and software architecture. I'm a big fan of React's declarative programming model.
