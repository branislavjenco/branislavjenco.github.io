I'm a software developer at [Sesam](https://sesam.io/), an data integration company based in Oslo where I'm dividing my time between backend (Python/C++) and frontend (React/Redux).

I previously worked as a full-stack developer at [Nornir](https://nornir.io/) in Oslo. Before that, I took a summer internship at [CERN](https://home.cern/), where I built a small web application for displaying data about beamlines operating in CERNs North & East Experimental Areas.

I have a Bachelor degree in Computer Graphics and Visualizations from [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/en) in Brno, Czech Republic. Currently I am also studying for a Masters degree at [IFI UiO](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/) in Oslo. I enjoy solving problems and learning about processing data, state reconciliation, control theory, declarative programming and other random topics.
